    <p>
      We aim for a best holiday destinations list that is geographically diverse, as well as one that covers a
      range of trips, from eco-tourism to adventure, to inspire every type of traveller. There are the
      destinations that have been on our radar for a while, but keep getting better: the food scene in a little
      town in Maine, for example, and in the UK, the somewhat surprising British seaside spot that has us talking.
      There are also the affordable, go-slow spots that other tourists haven’t reached yet. Then there are the
      destinations, that, while always a good idea, have an extra buzz going into 2020 – such as Paris, which has
      upcoming hotel openings that include the first Soho House in France and will see a new modern-art museum to
      rival the city’s existing world-class institutions. And here at Condé Nast Traveller, we always have one eye
      on the surf scene (where boarders flock, eco-entrepreneurs, independent hotels and small businesses tend to
      follow), and we’re predicting that during the next year a tiny Phillipine island will be stealing a cool
      crowd (whether they surf or not) from Bali.</p>
